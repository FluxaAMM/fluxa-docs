### 3.3 Workflow Triggers

GitHub Actions workflows are triggered by the following events:

- **Pull Request Events**: When a pull request is opened, synchronized, or reopened
- **Push Events**: When code is pushed to specific branches
- **Schedule Events**: Regular scheduled runs for tasks like security scanning
- **Manual Events**: Workflows that can be manually triggered via GitHub UI
- **Repository Dispatch Events**: External event triggers via GitHub API
- **Release Events**: When a release is created or a tag is pushed
- **Issue Events**: When issues are created or modified (for automation)

### 3.4 Environment Configuration

The pipeline uses GitHub Environments to manage different deployment targets:

| Environment   | Description                | Protection Rules                        | Required Reviewers            |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `development` | Solana Devnet environment  | None                                    | None                          |
| `staging`     | Solana Testnet environment | Required reviewers                      | Tech Lead                     |
| `production`  | Solana Mainnet environment | Required reviewers, wait timer (1 hour) | CTO, Security Lead, Tech Lead |

Each environment has its own set of secrets and variables:

- **Secrets**: Deployment keys, API tokens, wallet private keys (encrypted)
- **Variables**: Configuration parameters, feature flags, URLs

## 4. Development Workflow

### 4.1 Branching Strategy

Fluxa follows a trunk-based development strategy with short-lived feature branches:

- `main`: Production code, always deployable
- `staging`: Pre-production testing branch
- `develop`: Integration branch for development
- Feature branches: Short-lived branches for individual features or fixes

### 4.2 Pull Request Process

1. Developer creates a feature branch from `develop`
2. Developer implements changes and commits code
3. Developer opens a pull request to `develop`
4. CI pipeline automatically runs tests and checks
5. Code is reviewed by at least one team member
6. Pull request is merged after approvals and passing CI

### 4.3 Automated Pull Request Checks

Each pull request triggers the following automated checks:

- Code compilation and build verification
- Unit and integration tests
- Code style and linting checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Test coverage calculation
- Documentation validation

### 4.4 Pull Request Templates

Pull request templates are defined in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and include:

- Description of changes
- Related issue links
- Type of change (feature, bugfix, etc.)
- Checklist of required steps
- Testing steps and instructions
- Screenshots if applicable

## 11. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### 11.1 Pipeline Troubleshooting

Guidance for troubleshooting common pipeline issues:

1. **Build Failures**:

   - Check build logs for compilation errors
   - Verify dependency compatibility
   - Test locally with the same configuration

2. **Test Failures**:

   - Examine test logs for specific failures
   - Run failing tests locally to reproduce
   - Check for environment-specific issues

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Verify deployment credentials
   - Check network connectivity to deployment targets
   - Validate deployment configuration

### 11.2 Common Error Patterns

Solutions for frequent CI/CD errors:

| Error Pattern        | Common Causes                              | Resolution Steps                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build timeout        | Large dependency downloads, complex builds | Optimize build steps, use caching, increase timeout      |
| Test flakiness       | Race conditions, network issues            | Improve test stability, add retries, isolate flaky tests |
| Credential issues    | Expired secrets, incorrect permissions     | Rotate secrets, verify service principal permissions     |
| Out of memory errors | Resource-intensive processes               | Optimize resource usage, increase runner resources       |
| Deployment conflicts | Concurrent deployments, state conflicts    | Implement deployment locks, improve state management     |

### 11.3 Pipeline Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

- **Weekly**: Audit and rotate secrets
- **Monthly**: Update base images and dependencies
- **Quarterly**: Review and optimize workflows
- **As Needed**: Update to new GitHub Actions features

## 12. Pipeline Extensions

### 12.1 Custom GitHub Actions

The repository includes custom actions to streamline workflows:

```
.github/actions/
├── install-solana/        # Action to install Solana tools
├── install-anchor/        # Action to install Anchor framework
├── setup-integration-test/ # Action to set up integration test environment
├── setup-e2e-test/        # Action to set up E2E test environment
├── send-notification/     # Action to send various notifications
└── generate-deployment-info/ # Action to generate deployment information
```

Example of a custom action:

```yaml
# .github/actions/install-solana/action.yml
name: "Install Solana"
description: "Installs Solana CLI tools"
inputs:
  solana_version:
    description: "Solana version to install"
    required: true
    default: "1.16.0"

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Cache Solana install
      id: cache-solana
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.local/share/solana
        key: solana-${{ inputs.solana_version }}

    - name: Install Solana
      if: steps.cache-solana.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
      shell: bash
      run: |
        sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v${{ inputs.solana_version }}/install)"
        echo "$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

    - name: Set PATH
      shell: bash

      environment:
        required: true
        type: string
      build_args:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: ""
    outputs:
      build_id:
        description: "Build identifier"
        value: ${{ jobs.build.outputs.build_id }}

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      build_id: ${{ steps.generate_id.outputs.id }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
