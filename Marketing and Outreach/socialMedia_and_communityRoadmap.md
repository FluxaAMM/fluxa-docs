## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the social media and community engagement strategy for Fluxa during and after the 5-week hackathon period. Currently two weeks into the hackathon with minimal social media presence, this accelerated roadmap provides an immediate action plan to build momentum, engage with the community, and establish Fluxa's brand identity in the DeFi ecosystem on Solana.

The roadmap emphasizes:

- Rapid buildup of social presence with retroactive project updates
- Technical content that highlights Fluxa's innovative AMM design and IL mitigation
- Community-driven development with regular feedback sessions
- Strategic partnerships with key Solana ecosystem players
- Post-hackathon continuity to maintain momentum after the competition

This strategic approach aims to quickly establish Fluxa as a thought leader in DeFi liquidity solutions while building an engaged community of users, liquidity providers, developers, and ecosystem partners.
