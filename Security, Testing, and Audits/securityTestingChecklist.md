# Security Testing Checklist

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security testing requirements for the Fluxa protocol—a Hybrid Adaptive AMM with Personalized Yield Optimization on Solana. The checklist is divided into several testing categories to ensure comprehensive coverage, from basic unit tests to advanced fuzz and integration tests. It is intended to be used as a reference for developers, auditors, and stakeholders to ensure that every module meets robust security standards.

## 2. Unit Testing

### 2.1 AMM Core Module

#### Liquidity Calculations

- Verify that liquidity ranges are correctly calculated based on current price.
- Ensure that fee accrual and distribution match expected results.

#### Invariant Checks

- Ensure that the total liquidity before and after swaps remains consistent.
- Validate that no position exceeds its deposit amount upon withdrawal.

### 2.2 Order Book Module

#### Order Placement & Cancellation

- Test placing, modifying, and canceling orders.
- Ensure that invalid orders (e.g., with out-of-bound prices or quantities) are rejected.

#### Order Matching

- Confirm that the matching engine processes orders in the correct sequence.
- Validate that partial fills and full order executions are correctly handled.

### 2.3 Impermanent Loss Mitigation Module

#### Dynamic Curve Adjustment

- Verify that liquidity curves adjust correctly under various simulated volatility scenarios.
- Test the triggering of rebalancing events and insurance fund activations.

### 2.4 Personalized Yield Optimization Module

#### Risk Profile Logic

- Ensure that yield strategy adjustments (compounding frequency, rebalancing triggers) align with selected risk profiles.
- Validate that performance analytics reflect accurate, real-time calculations.

### 2.5 Insurance Fund Module

#### Fee Collection & Payouts

- Test that fees are correctly accumulated from transactions.
- Confirm that payout logic triggers when impermanent loss exceeds predefined thresholds.

## 3. Integration Testing

### 3.1 Cross-Module Interactions

#### Atomicity & State Consistency

- Validate that state transitions between the AMM, order book, and IL mitigation modules occur atomically.
- Simulate concurrent transactions to ensure proper state updates without race conditions.

### 3.2 External Integrations via CPIs

#### Oracles & Data Feeds

- Test integration with multiple oracle sources; ensure data aggregation and fallback mechanisms work correctly.

#### Inter-Protocol Communication

- Verify error handling and recovery when interacting with external protocols like Jupiter Aggregator, Marinade, Solend, and Kamino.

## 4. Fuzz Testing & Property-Based Testing

### 4.1 Fuzz Testing

#### Randomized Input Testing

- Use fuzzing tools to generate random inputs for liquidity functions, order matching, and rebalancing logic.
- Identify potential edge cases or unexpected behavior under stress conditions.

### 4.2 Property-Based Testing

#### Invariant Properties

- Ensure key invariants (e.g., conservation of liquidity, fee integrity) are maintained regardless of input permutations.
- Test across a broad range of simulated market conditions and user interactions.

## 5. Formal Verification

### Critical Functions

- Consider using formal verification methods for the most critical functions (e.g., liquidity math, insurance fund payout logic) to mathematically prove correctness.

### Verification Tools

- Explore integration with available formal verification tools tailored to Rust or Solana’s programming environment.

## 6. Security Audits

### Third-Party Audits

- Schedule audits with reputable blockchain security firms once internal testing is complete.
- Ensure audit reports are reviewed and recommendations implemented before mainnet deployment.

## 7. Documentation & Reporting

### Test Coverage Reports

- Maintain detailed reports on unit, integration, and fuzz testing coverage.
- Include logs of detected issues, their resolutions, and regression testing results.
