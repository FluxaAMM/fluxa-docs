## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive security testing checklist for the Fluxa protocol. It outlines the necessary security tests, checks, and validations required to ensure that the protocol meets its security objectives and adequately mitigates the risks identified in the Threat Model and Risk Assessment.

This checklist covers security testing for all components of the Fluxa protocol, including:

- AMM Core and concentrated liquidity mechanism
- Order book integration and hybrid market model
- Impermanent loss mitigation system
- Personalized yield optimization engine
- Insurance fund and safety mechanisms
- External protocol integrations (Jupiter, Marinade, Solend)
- Oracle integrations (Pyth, Switchboard)
- Client-side applications and interfaces
- Operational security controls

#### 15.3.2 AMM and DeFi Vulnerability Patterns

| Vulnerability          | Testing Pattern                                  | Example                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Price Manipulation     | Test price impact limits and oracle dependencies | Setting price bounds or requiring multiple oracle confirmations     |
| Flash Loan Attack      | Test protocol behavior with extreme liquidity    | Check behavior when large amounts are borrowed and returned quickly |
| Sandwich Attack        | Test MEV protection mechanisms                   | Identify if transactions can be front-run/back-run for profit       |
| Fee Calculation Error  | Verify fee calculations with boundary conditions | Check fee rounding, distribution, and consistency                   |
| Slippage Exploitation  | Test slippage bounds enforcement                 | Verify minimum output amount is enforced strictly                   |
| Impermanent Loss Abuse | Test IL protection mechanism limits              | Ensure IL compensation can't be gamed                               |

#### 15.3.3 Oracle Vulnerability Patterns

| Vulnerability       | Testing Pattern                            | Example                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stale Price Data    | Test timestamp validation                  | Check if prices older than threshold are rejected                |
| Oracle Manipulation | Test price deviation limits                | Verify extreme price movements trigger additional verification   |
| Oracle Failure      | Test fallback mechanisms                   | Check behavior when primary oracle is unavailable                |
| Inconsistent Prices | Test multi-oracle consistency requirements | Verify price deviation across oracles is within acceptable range |
