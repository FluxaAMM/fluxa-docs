## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Threat Modeling Approach

This assessment utilizes a hybrid threat modeling approach combining aspects of multiple established methodologies:

#### 2.1.1 STRIDE Model

The STRIDE threat classification framework is used to categorize threats:

- **S**poofing: Impersonating users or system components
- **T**ampering: Modifying data or program state
- **R**epudiation: Denying actions or transactions
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Exposing private information
- **D**enial of Service: Disrupting system availability
- **E**levation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized capabilities

#### 2.1.2 DREAD Risk Assessment Model

The DREAD model is used to evaluate risk impact:

- **D**amage: How severe is the damage if the threat succeeds?
- **R**eproducibility: How easily can the attack be reproduced?
- **E**xploitability: How much effort is required to exploit the vulnerability?
- **A**ffected Users: What is the scope of affected users if exploited?
- **D**iscoverability: How easily can the vulnerability be discovered?

#### 2.1.3 Attack Trees

Attack trees are used to model specific threat scenarios, showing how an attacker might achieve their objectives through a series of steps.

### 2.2 Risk Assessment Method

Risk is calculated using the following formula:

```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

Where:

- **Likelihood**: Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, rated from 1 (rare) to 5 (almost certain)
- **Impact**: Severity of consequences if a threat is realized, rated from 1 (negligible) to 5 (catastrophic)

Resulting in a risk score between 1 and 25, categorized as:

- **Low Risk**: 1-6
- **Medium Risk**: 7-12
- **High Risk**: 13-18
- **Critical Risk**: 19-25

### 2.3 Assessment Process

The assessment followed this process:

1. System decomposition and component identification
2. Data flow analysis and trust boundary definition
3. Threat identification per component using STRIDE
4. Vulnerability assessment for each component
5. Risk calculation based on likelihood and impact
6. Mitigation strategy development
7. Residual risk determination

### 9.2 Risk Acceptance Criteria

Risks are accepted based on the following criteria:

1. **Inherent Blockchain Limitations**: Some risks arise from the fundamental design of blockchain systems and cannot be fully eliminated
2. **Economic Efficiency**: When the cost of mitigation exceeds the expected loss from the risk
3. **Market Functioning Requirements**: When mitigating the risk would significantly impair protocol functionality or user experience
4. **External Dependencies**: Risks dependent on external protocols or infrastructure beyond Fluxa's direct control
5. **Technical Limitations**: When current technology does not allow for complete elimination of the risk
6. **Extremely Low Likelihood**: Risks with very low probability of occurrence but potentially high impact
7. **Adequate Partial Mitigation**: When the residual risk after partial mitigation is within acceptable bounds

### 9.3 Risk Monitoring Plan

For accepted risks, the following monitoring approach is established:

1. **Regular Reassessment**: Quarterly review of accepted risk status and applicability of acceptance criteria
2. **Trigger-Based Review**: Immediate reassessment when relevant external factors change (e.g., significant protocol updates, market conditions)
3. **Risk Metric Tracking**: Development of specific metrics to track each accepted risk's indicators and precursors
4. **Early Warning System**: Implementation of alert thresholds below the critical level to provide early warning of evolving risk
5. **Contingency Planning**: Development of specific incident response procedures for accepted risks if they do materialize

### 10.1 Risk Assessment Methodology

Detailed explanation of risk scoring methodology and criteria:

#### 10.1.1 Likelihood Scoring Criteria

| Score | Rating         | Criteria                                                                  |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Rare           | Event occurs only in exceptional circumstances; less than once per year   |
| 2     | Unlikely       | Event could occur at some time; approximately once per year               |
| 3     | Possible       | Event might occur at some time; several times per year                    |
| 4     | Likely         | Event will probably occur in most circumstances; monthly or more frequent |
| 5     | Almost Certain | Event is expected to occur in most circumstances; weekly or more frequent |

#### 10.1.2 Impact Scoring Criteria

| Score | Rating       | Financial Impact              | User Impact                                      | Reputational Impact                                |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Negligible   | <$10,000 loss                 | Few users affected, minimal disruption           | Minor internal concern                             |
| 2     | Minor        | $10,000 - $100,000 loss       | <5% of users affected, limited disruption        | Limited external awareness, quickly forgotten      |
| 3     | Moderate     | $100,000 - $1,000,000 loss    | 5-15% of users affected, noticeable disruption   | Some external awareness, short-term impact         |
| 4     | Major        | $1,000,000 - $10,000,000 loss | 15-30% of users affected, significant disruption | Significant external awareness, medium-term impact |

#### 10.1.3 Risk Calculation

Risk scores are calculated by multiplying the likelihood score by the impact score, resulting in a value between 1 and 25. The risk categories are defined as:

- **Low Risk**: 1-6
- **Medium Risk**: 7-12
- **High Risk**: 13-18
- **Critical Risk**: 19-25

### 10.3 Reference Attack Scenarios

Detailed analysis of key attack scenarios:

#### 10.3.1 Flash Loan Price Manipulation Attack

An attacker attempts to manipulate the price in Fluxa pools for profit by:

1. Taking a flash loan from a lending protocol like Solend
2. Using borrowed funds to execute a large swap in a Fluxa pool to push the price significantly in one direction
3. Taking advantage of the manipulated price in one of several ways:
   - Executing trades on integrated DEXs that use Fluxa as a price reference
   - Triggering liquidations of positions at unfavorable prices
   - Claiming excessive impermanent loss compensation
4. Unwinding the position and repaying the flash loan

**Target**: Price integrity in AMM pools
**Impact**: Financial losses for users and protocol
**Key Mitigation**: Multi-block TWAP prices for critical operations, flash loan detection mechanisms, circuit breakers

#### 10.3.2 Cross-Protocol Integration Vulnerability

An attacker exploits the permissions granted to the Fluxa protocol for external integrations by:

1. Analyzing the permission model between Fluxa and integrated protocols
2. Identifying a transaction flow that can be manipulated to access privileged functions
3. Using Fluxa's integration as a proxy to execute unauthorized actions in the target protocol
4. Extracting value from the target protocol through the vulnerability

**Target**: External protocol integration security boundaries
**Impact**: Security breach in both Fluxa and integrated protocols
**Key Mitigation**: Strict permission scoping, integration security reviews, minimal authority delegation

#### 10.3.3 Impermanent Loss Compensation Exploitation

An attacker attempts to drain the insurance fund by artificially generating impermanent loss:

1. Creating positions in pools with specific token pairs known for high volatility
2. Using market manipulation techniques in related markets to increase volatility
3. Closing positions at precisely timed moments to maximize impermanent loss
4. Claiming excessive compensation from the insurance fund
5. Repeating the process until mitigations are implemented

**Target**: Insurance fund reserves
**Impact**: Depletion of insurance reserves, inability to compensate legitimate users
**Key Mitigation**: Per-user insurance caps, suspicious activity detection, risk-based claim verification
