## 1. Executive Summary

Fluxa is a next-generation Hybrid Adaptive AMM with Personalized Yield Optimization built on Solana. Our protocol combines the efficiency of concentrated liquidity with the precision of an order book model, while addressing the critical challenges of impermanent loss and yield optimization faced by DeFi users.

The Fluxa business model is designed to create sustainable revenue while driving platform adoption and liquidity growth. Rather than simply extracting value from users, our approach aligns incentives between liquidity providers, traders, yield seekers, and the protocol itself. Through a carefully calibrated fee structure and innovative tokenomics, Fluxa establishes multiple revenue streams that scale with protocol usage while maintaining competitive pricing in the Solana DeFi ecosystem.

Currently participating in the Solana Breakout Hackathon (Colosseum), Fluxa aims to secure a position in the accelerator program, which would provide $250,000 in initial funding. This capital will be strategically deployed to finalize core protocol development, conduct security audits, build initial liquidity partnerships, and execute our go-to-market strategy.

### Key Highlights:

- **Market Opportunity**: $80B+ in AMM trading volume on Solana annually with significant room for improved capital efficiency
- **Primary Revenue Streams**: Trading fees, IL insurance premiums, yield strategy fees, and order book fees
- **Competitive Edge**: Hybrid model combining concentrated liquidity with order book precision and proprietary IL mitigation
- **Initial Traction**: Development of core protocol and participation in Solana Breakout Hackathon
- **Growth Targets**: $25M TVL by month 6, $100M TVL by month 12, and $500M TVL by month 24
- **Funding Strategy**: Secure $250K from accelerator program, followed by strategic $1.5M seed round to achieve key milestones before Series A
