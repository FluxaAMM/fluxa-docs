## 1. Executive Summary

Fluxa's tokenomics and fee design establishes a sustainable economic foundation for the protocol's long-term growth while aligning the incentives of all stakeholders. The FLUXA token serves multiple functions, including governance rights, fee discounts, liquidity incentives, and economic alignment. This document outlines a carefully calibrated token distribution, fee structure, and incentive mechanisms that ensure protocol sustainability while rewarding participants proportionally to their contribution.

The model balances several key objectives:

1. **Economic Sustainability**: Generating sufficient revenue to maintain and enhance the protocol
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Aligning interests across liquidity providers, traders, and token holders
3. **Value Capture**: Ensuring protocol-generated value flows back to ecosystem participants
4. **Capital Efficiency**: Maximizing the productive use of assets within the ecosystem
5. **Risk Management**: Maintaining sufficient reserves to protect against impermanent loss and other risks

Our approach emphasizes long-term stability over short-term token price appreciation, with value accrual mechanisms that tie token value directly to protocol success. The governance framework further empowers the community to refine and adapt the economic parameters as the protocol evolves.

## 2. Token Fundamentals

### 2.1 Token Overview

| Parameter          | Value                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Name**     | Fluxa Token                                        |
| **Token Symbol**   | FLUXA                                              |
| **Blockchain**     | Solana                                             |
| **Token Standard** | SPL Token                                          |
| **Initial Supply** | 100,000,000 FLUXA                                  |
| **Max Supply**     | 100,000,000 FLUXA (fixed supply with no inflation) |
| **Decimals**       | 9                                                  |

### 2.2 Token Contract Parameters

| Parameter             | Value                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Contract Address**  | To be deployed             |
| **Minting Authority** | Fluxa Treasury (multi-sig) |
| **Freeze Authority**  | None                       |
| **Transfer Fee**      | None                       |
| **Interest Rate**     | None                       |
| **Metadata URI**      | To be determined           |

### 2.3 Token Design Principles

Fluxa's token model adheres to the following key principles:

1. **Value Reflection**: Token value should directly reflect protocol success through fee sharing and buybacks
2. **Proof of Contribution**: Rewards should be proportional to the value contributed to the ecosystem
3. **Governance Utility**: Meaningful governance rights for genuine protocol improvement
4. **Long-Term Alignment**: Vesting schedules and lock-ups that encourage long-term alignment
5. **Capital Efficiency**: Mechanisms that optimize for productive capital utilization
6. **Deflationary Pressure**: Structured mechanisms to create sustainable scarcity as usage grows
7. **Decentralization**: Progressive decentralization of token distribution and governance control

## 3. Token Utility and Value Accrual

### 3.1 Core Utility Functions

#### 3.1.1 Governance Rights

- **Proposal Power**: 100,000 FLUXA required to submit governance proposals
- **Voting Weight**: 1 FLUXA = 1 vote in standard governance
- **Delegation**: Token holders can delegate voting power to other addresses
- **Governance Scope**:
  - Protocol fee parameters
  - IL insurance mechanism parameters
  - Incentive distribution
  - Protocol upgrades and integrations
  - Treasury fund allocation

#### 3.1.2 Fee Discounts and Benefits

| Staking Tier | Required FLUXA | Trading Fee Discount | IL Protection Discount | Yield Strategy Discount |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Basic**    | 1,000          | 5%                   | 5%                     | 5%                      |
| **Silver**   | 5,000          | 10%                  | 10%                    | 10%                     |
| **Gold**     | 25,000         | 15%                  | 15%                    | 15%                     |
| **Platinum** | 100,000        | 20%                  | 20%                    | 20%                     |

#### 3.1.3 Liquidity Mining Boosts

| Boost Tier   | Required FLUXA | Liquidity Mining Multiplier |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Standard** | 0              | 1.0x                        |
| **Enhanced** | 2,500          | 1.25x                       |
| **Premium**  | 10,000         | 1.5x                        |
| **Elite**    | 50,000         | 2.0x                        |

#### 3.1.4 Insurance Fund Backing

- FLUXA tokens serve as collateral in the protocol's IL insurance system
- Stakers can opt to allocate tokens to the insurance fund for additional rewards
- Insurance fund stakers receive 40% of the IL insurance premiums

### 3.2 Value Accrual Mechanisms

#### 3.2.1 Fee Sharing Model

- 30% of all protocol fees distributed to FLUXA stakers
- Distribution proportional to staking amount and duration
- Weekly distribution of accrued fees

#### 3.2.2 Buyback and Burn

- 10% of protocol fees used for token buybacks
- 100% of bought-back tokens permanently burned
- Buybacks executed through on-chain AMM interactions (Jupiter)
- Weekly buyback schedule with volume limitations to prevent market impact

#### 3.2.3 Value Accrual Formula

The value accrued to each staked token can be calculated as:

```
Token Annual Yield = (Annual Protocol Fees × 0.3 × Individual Stake) ÷ Total Staked FLUXA
```

For example, if:

- Annual Protocol Fees = $5,000,000
- Total Staked FLUXA = 60,000,000
- Individual Stake = 10,000 FLUXA

Then:

```
Token Annual Yield = ($5,000,000 × 0.3 × 10,000) ÷ 60,000,000 = $250
```

This equates to $0.025 per token per year at these volumes, or approximately 2.5% yield at a $1 token price.

### 5.1 Fee Categories and Rates

| Fee Category                  | Base Rate | Protocol Share | LP Share | Insurance Fund | Notes                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Standard Swap**             | 0.25%     | 0.05%          | 0.18%    | 0.02%          | Standard AMM liquidity swaps      |
| **Stable Pair Swap**          | 0.05%     | 0.01%          | 0.04%    | 0.00%          | Stablecoin to stablecoin swaps    |

### 5.2 Dynamic Fee Adjustment

The protocol implements dynamic fee adjustments based on market conditions:

#### 5.2.1 Volatility-Based Adjustments

| Market Volatility | Fee Adjustment | New Standard Rate | Rationale                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Very Low**      | -0.05%         | 0.20%             | Increased competitiveness in stable markets |
| **Low**           | -0.02%         | 0.23%             | Slightly reduced fees                       |
| **Normal**        | 0.00%          | 0.25%             | Baseline fee structure                      |
| **High**          | +0.05%         | 0.30%             | Compensation for increased IL risk          |
| **Extreme**       | +0.10%         | 0.35%             | Protection during market turbulence         |

Volatility is calculated as the 24-hour standard deviation of 5-minute returns, normalized against a 30-day moving average.

#### 5.2.2 Utilization-Based Adjustments

| Pool Utilization | Fee Adjustment | Rationale                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **< 20%**        | -0.03%         | Incentivize activity in underutilized pools  |
| **20% - 40%**    | -0.01%         | Slight incentive for increased usage         |
| **40% - 60%**    | 0.00%          | Optimal utilization range                    |
| **60% - 80%**    | +0.01%         | Mild fee increase as efficiency decreases    |
| **> 80%**        | +0.03%         | Higher fees to protect LPs during high usage |

Utilization is measured as the ratio of 24-hour trading volume to total liquidity in the pool.

#### 5.2.3 Token Holder Discounts

Staked FLUXA tokens provide fee discounts as detailed in section 3.1.2.

### 5.3 Fee Implementation Details

#### 5.3.1 Fee Collection Mechanism

```rust
pub fn calculate_fees(
    amount_in: u64,
    fee_tier: FeeTier,
    volatility_adjustment: i8,
    utilization_adjustment: i8,
    user_discount_bps: u16
) -> Result<FeeBreakdown> {
    // Convert bps adjustments to fee multipliers
    let volatility_multiplier = 10000 + volatility_adjustment as i64;
    let utilization_multiplier = 10000 + utilization_adjustment as i64;
    let discount_multiplier = 10000 - user_discount_bps as i64;

    // Calculate adjusted fee rate
    let adjusted_fee_rate = (fee_tier.fee_bps as i64 * volatility_multiplier * utilization_multiplier * discount_multiplier) / (10000 * 10000 * 10000);

    // Calculate fee amount
    let fee_amount = (amount_in as i64 * adjusted_fee_rate) / 10000;

    // Calculate fee breakdown
    let protocol_fee = (fee_amount * fee_tier.protocol_share_bps as i64) / 10000;
    let lp_fee = (fee_amount * fee_tier.lp_share_bps as i64) / 10000;
    let insurance_fee = (fee_amount * fee_tier.insurance_share_bps as i64) / 10000;

    // Return breakdown
    Ok(FeeBreakdown {
        total_fee: fee_amount as u64,
        protocol_fee: protocol_fee as u64,
        lp_fee: lp_fee as u64,
        insurance_fee: insurance_fee as u64,
    })
}
```

#### 5.3.2 Fee Accounting

Each fee component is tracked separately:

1. **LP Fees**: Directly accrued to the respective liquidity pool and tracked per LP position
2. **Protocol Fees**: Transferred to the protocol fee account for distribution
3. **Insurance Fees**: Transferred to the insurance fund account

### 5.4 Fee Competitiveness Analysis

| Protocol    | Standard Fee | Stable Pair Fee | IL Protection | Protocol Revenue |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Fluxa**   | 0.25%        | 0.05%           | Optional      | 20% of fees      |
| **Orca**    | 0.30%        | 0.05%           | None          | 0% of fees       |
| **Raydium** | 0.25%        | 0.05%           | None          | 30% of fees      |
| **Jupiter** | 0.20-0.80%   | 0.05-0.10%      | None          | Routing fees     |
| **Saber**   | N/A          | 0.04%           | None          | 15% of fees      |

## 6. Fee Allocation and Distribution

### 6.1 Fee Distribution Formula

Protocol fees are distributed according to the following formula:

```
Protocol Fee = Total Fee × Protocol Share Percentage
```

These protocol fees are then allocated as follows:

```
Staker Rewards = Protocol Fee × 0.3
Buyback and Burn = Protocol Fee × 0.1
Treasury = Protocol Fee × 0.2
Development Fund = Protocol Fee × 0.4
```

### 6.2 Distribution Mechanisms

| Component          | Description                                     | Distribution Frequency | Distribution Mechanism            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **LP Rewards**     | Direct fee accrual to LPs based on contribution | Real-time accrual      | Position-specific accounting      |
| **Staker Rewards** | Share of protocol fees to stakers               | Weekly                 | Proportional to stake amount/time |
| **Buyback & Burn** | Automated token burns                           | Weekly                 | On-chain execution via AMM        |
| **Treasury**       | Long-term funding for protocol                  | N/A (accumulation)     | Multi-sig controlled account      |
| **Development**    | Ongoing protocol development                    | Monthly                | Multi-sig controlled account      |

### 6.3 Insurance Fund Allocation

The insurance fund receives:

- Direct insurance premium fees
- 40% of IL insurance special fees
- Investment returns from fund capital

Insurance fund allocation follows this distribution:

- 80% available for active IL coverage
- 15% invested in yield strategies for fund growth
- 5% maintained as immediate reserves

### 6.4 Fee Distribution Contract Example

pub fn process_proposal(
    proposal_id: u64,
    votes_for: u64,
    votes_against: u64,
    votes_abstain: u64,
    total_supply: u64,
    params: GovernanceParameters,
) -> Result<ProposalStatus> {
    // Calculate total votes
    let total_votes = votes_for + votes_against + votes_abstain;

    // Check quorum requirement
    let quorum_requirement = total_supply * params.quorum_bps / 10000;
    if total_votes < quorum_requirement {
        return Ok(ProposalStatus::Failed { reason: "Quorum not reached" });
    }

    // Calculate approval percentage
    let approval_percentage = votes_for * 10000 / (votes_for + votes_against);

    // Check if proposal passed
    if approval_percentage >= params.approval_threshold_bps {
        return Ok(ProposalStatus::Passed {
            timelock_end: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp + params.timelock_delay,
            execution_deadline: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp + params.timelock_delay + params.execution_window
        });
    } else {
        return Ok(ProposalStatus::Failed { reason: "Approval threshold not met" });
    }
}
```

### 13.1 Token Contract Specification

```rust
#[program]
pub mod fluxa_token {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, initial_supply: u64) -> Result<()> {
        let token_mint = &mut ctx.accounts.token_mint;
        let token_authority = &mut ctx.accounts.token_authority;

        // Initialize token mint with details
        token_mint.mint_authority = Some(*token_authority.key);
        token_mint.freeze_authority = None;
        token_mint.decimals = 9;
        token_mint.supply = initial_supply;

        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn mint_tokens(ctx: Context<MintTokens>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // Verify mint authority
        require_keys_eq!(
            ctx.accounts.token_mint.mint_authority.unwrap(),
            *ctx.accounts.authority.key,
            ErrorCode::InvalidAuthority
        );

        // Mint new tokens to recipient
        token::mint_to(
            ctx.accounts.into_mint_to_context(),
            amount
        )?;

        // Update total supply
        ctx.accounts.token_mint.supply += amount;

        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn burn_tokens(ctx: Context<BurnTokens>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // Burn tokens from specified account
        token::burn(
            ctx.accounts.into_burn_context(),
            amount
        )?;

        // Update total supply
        ctx.accounts.token_mint.supply -= amount;

        Ok(())
    }

    // Additional token management functions...
}
```

### 13.2 Economic Model Simulations

Sample simulation results from tokenomics modeling:

| Scenario                   | Protocol Revenue | Token Price Impact  | Staking Rate | Insurance Fund Growth |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| **Base Case**              | $5M Year 1       | Stable growth       | 60%          | 15% annual growth     |
| **High Adoption**          | $12M Year 1      | Strong appreciation | 70%          | 25% annual growth     |
| **Low Adoption**           | $2M Year 1       | Decline             | 40%          | 5% annual growth      |
| **High Market Volatility** | $7M Year 1       | High volatility     | 65%          | 20% annual growth     |
| **Fee Competition**        | $3M Year 1       | Modest decline      | 55%          | 10% annual growth     |
| **Bull Market**            | $15M Year 1      | Strong appreciation | 75%          | 30% annual growth     |
| **Bear Market**            | $1.5M Year 1     | Significant decline | 80%          | -5% annual growth     |

### 13.3 Fee Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Standard Swap**

- Swap Amount: 10,000 USDC to SOL
- Base Fee Rate: 0.25% (25 bps)
- Adjustments: None
- User: No FLUXA staked (no discount)

Calculation:

- Fee Amount = 10,000 × 0.0025 = 25 USDC
- Protocol Share = 25 × 0.2 = 5 USDC
- LP Share = 25 × 0.72 = 18 USDC
- Insurance Fund = 25 × 0.08 = 2 USDC

**Example 2: Stable Pair Swap with Discount**

- Swap Amount: 50,000 USDC to USDT
- Base Fee Rate: 0.05% (5 bps)
- User: Gold Tier (15% discount)
- Adjusted Rate: 0.05% × (1 - 0.15) = 0.0425%

Calculation:

- Fee Amount = 50,000 × 0.000425 = 21.25 USDC
- Protocol Share = 21.25 × 0.2 = 4.25 USDC
- LP Share = 21.25 × 0.8 = 17 USDC
- Insurance Fund = 0 USDC

**Example 3: High Volatility Scenario**

- Swap Amount: 5,000 SOL to USDC
- Base Fee Rate: 0.25% (25 bps)
- Volatility Adjustment: +0.1% (10 bps)
- User: Silver Tier (10% discount)
- Adjusted Rate: (0.25% + 0.1%) × (1 - 0.1) = 0.315%

Calculation:

- Fee Amount = 5,000 × 0.00315 = 15.75 SOL
- Protocol Share = 15.75 × 0.2 = 3.15 SOL
- LP Share = 15.75 × 0.72 = 11.34 SOL
- Insurance Fund = 15.75 × 0.08 = 1.26 SOL
