## 1. Executive Summary

The Fluxa Governance Framework and Constitution establishes the foundational principles, processes, and structures through which the Fluxa protocol will be governed. This document codifies the transition from initial team-led development to a fully decentralized, community-governed protocol that serves the best interests of all stakeholders.

Fluxa's governance model is designed to be:

- **Accessible**: Making participation possible for all stakeholders
- **Transparent**: Ensuring all decisions and processes are visible and understandable
- **Accountable**: Holding decision-makers responsible to the community
- **Efficient**: Enabling timely decision-making while maintaining security
- **Adaptable**: Evolving as the protocol and ecosystem mature

The framework outlined in this document provides for community participation in protocol governance through the FLUXA token, with specific mechanisms for proposal submission, deliberation, voting, and implementation. It also defines safety measures to protect against malicious actions or unintended consequences.

As Fluxa evolves, this governance framework will mature through a carefully planned progression toward complete decentralization, with each phase expanding community control while maintaining protocol stability and security.

## 2. Core Principles and Values

### 2.1 Guiding Principles

The following principles guide Fluxa's governance and operations:

1. **Protocol Security**: The security and stability of the protocol must be prioritized above all else.

2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Governance decisions should align incentives across all stakeholders including liquidity providers, traders, yield seekers, and token holders.

3. **Sustainable Economics**: The protocol must maintain economically sustainable operations that generate long-term value for participants.

4. **Continuous Innovation**: The protocol should constantly evolve and improve based on research, feedback, and technological advances.

5. **Capital Efficiency**: Resources should be allocated to maximize efficient capital utilization across the DeFi ecosystem.

6. **Accessibility**: Protocol features and governance should be accessible to users of varying technical expertise and capital resources.

7. **Transparency**: Decision-making processes, protocol metrics, and governance activities must be fully transparent to all participants.

### 2.2 Constitutional Values

The Fluxa Constitution is founded on the following core values:

#### 2.2.1 Community Primacy

The Fluxa protocol exists to serve its community. Governance decisions must prioritize the collective long-term interest of the community over individual or short-term gains.

#### 2.2.2 Fairness and Inclusion

Fluxa governance will strive for fairness in representation and decision-making, ensuring that various stakeholder groups have appropriate voice and influence.

#### 2.2.3 Responsible Innovation

Fluxa will pursue innovation responsibly, with appropriate testing, security reviews, and risk assessment before implementing significant changes.

#### 2.2.4 Ecosystem Stewardship

Fluxa recognizes its role in the broader Solana and DeFi ecosystems and will act as a responsible participant that contributes positively to ecosystem health.

#### 2.2.5 Decentralization

Fluxa commits to progressive decentralization, reducing central points of control over time and empowering the community to direct the protocol's evolution.

## 3. Governance Structure

### 3.1 Governance Bodies

Fluxa's governance structure comprises the following bodies:

#### 3.1.1 Token Holders

FLUXA token holders form the foundation of the governance system, with voting power proportional to their token holdings. Token holders may vote directly or delegate their voting power to delegates.

#### 3.1.2 Delegates

Community members who receive delegated voting power from token holders. Active delegates who demonstrate expertise and commitment may gain significant influence in governance.

#### 3.1.3 Core Contributors

Team members and contributors who actively work on protocol development, operations, and community building. Core contributors have special proposal privileges during the early phases of governance.

#### 3.1.4 Security Council

A multisig group responsible for emergency actions and security-critical decisions. The Security Council has limited, specific powers focused exclusively on maintaining protocol security.

#### 3.1.5 Working Groups

Specialized teams focused on specific aspects of protocol operations and development. Working groups operate with delegated authority for day-to-day decisions within their domain.

6. **Voting Period**: 5-day period for token holder voting
7. **Timelock**: 2-day delay before implementation (if approved)
8. **Execution**: Technical implementation of approved changes
9. **Monitoring**: Tracking outcomes and impact of implemented changes

### 4.3 Proposal Requirements

#### 4.3.1 Submission Requirements

| Requirement                | Standard Proposal          | Technical Proposal                        | Constitutional Amendment        | Community Micro-Proposal      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Minimum Token Holding**  | 100,000 FLUXA              | 100,000 FLUXA                             | 500,000 FLUXA                   | **10,000 FLUXA**              |

#### 4.3.2 Proposal Template Elements

Each formal proposal must include:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Author(s)**: Names or pseudonyms of proposers
- **Type**: Proposal type from the defined categories
- **Simple Summary**: 2-3 sentence non-technical explanation
- **Abstract**: More detailed explanation of the proposal
- **Motivation**: Why this change should be made
- **Specification**: Detailed technical implementation
- **Benefits**: Expected positive outcomes
- **Drawbacks**: Potential negative outcomes or risks
- **Timeline**: Expected implementation schedule
- **Success Metrics**: How outcomes will be measured

#### 4.3.3 Community Micro-Proposal Track

The Community Micro-Proposal track enables broader participation in governance by lowering barriers to proposal submission:

- **Purpose**: Enable smaller token holders to contribute meaningful governance proposals
- **Scope**: Limited to specific categories:
  - Parameter adjustments within restricted ranges
  - Community fund allocations under $25,000
  - Feature requests (non-binding)
  - Community programs and initiatives
  - UI/UX improvements
- **Process**:
  1. Submit using simplified template
  2. Initial community discussion (5-day period)
  3. Delegate sponsorship required (minimum 1 delegate)
  4. Delegate can fast-track to formal proposal
  5. Modified voting process (3-day voting period)
- **Implementation**: Successful micro-proposals receive priority consideration from relevant working groups or move directly to implementation if within pre-approved scopes

### 4.4 Proposal Review and Feedback

Proposals undergo review by:

1. **Community Review**: Open discussion by all community members
2. **Technical Review**: Core contributors and technical delegates review technical feasibility
3. **Economic Review**: Assessment of economic impacts and risks
4. **Security Review**: For code changes, security assessment by qualified reviewers

Feedback is consolidated and may result in proposal revisions before voting.

## 5. Voting Mechanisms

### 5.1 Voting Power Calculation

Voting power in Fluxa governance is calculated based on:

1. **Base Voting Power**: 1 FLUXA token = 1 base vote
2. **Time-Weighted Bonus**: Implemented from Phase 1 (rather than future phases) to promote long-term alignment:

   | Lock Duration    | Voting Power Multiplier | Example (10,000 FLUXA) |
   | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | No lock (liquid) | 1.0x                    | 10,000 votes           |
   | 1 month lock     | 1.05x                   | 10,500 votes           |
   | 3 month lock     | 1.1x                    | 11,000 votes           |
   | 6 month lock     | 1.2x                    | 12,000 votes           |
   | 12 month lock    | 1.3x                    | 13,000 votes           |

3. **Quadratic Voting** (future): Voting power calculated as the square root of tokens (to be implemented in later phases)

The time-weighted voting power ensures that engaged, long-term community members have proportionally stronger influence in governance decisions, while still maintaining the core principle that more tokens equal more votes.

### 5.2 Delegation System

Token holders may delegate their voting power to delegates who represent their interests:

- Delegation is revocable at any time
- Multiple delegation levels are not supported (no re-delegation)
- Delegates cannot exceed the voting power delegated to them
- Delegation history is publicly visible on-chain
- Delegation does not transfer tokens or economic rights

### 5.3 Voting Process

| Stage                 | Duration | Actions                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Execution Period**  | 7 days   | • Approved proposal implemented<br>• Status updates provided<br>• If not executed, requires new proposal        |

### 5.4 Vote Types

Voters may select from the following options:

- **For**: Approve the proposal as written
- **Against**: Reject the proposal
- **Abstain**: Formally participate without taking a position

Quorum calculations include all non-abstaining votes.

### 5.5 Special Voting Rules

#### 5.5.1 Concurrent Proposal Handling

- Related proposals are grouped and noted in the submission
- Conflicting proposals require sequential voting
- If multiple conflicting proposals pass, highest approval percentage is implemented

#### 5.5.2 Revoting Rules

- Failed proposals may not be resubmitted in substantially similar form for 30 days
- Minor variations of failed proposals must include significant changes

#### 5.5.3 Vote Transparency

All votes are publicly recorded on-chain with:

### 12.3 Centralization Circuit-Breakers

To protect against governance failure, certain circuit-breakers exist:

1. **Governance Participation Floor**: If participation falls below 3% for 3 consecutive votes, emergency governance review triggered
2. **Security Council Failsafe**: If Security Council cannot reach quorum for 72 hours during emergency, core team backup mechanism
3. **Governance Attack Prevention**: Monitoring for governance attacks with pause capability
4. **Economic Parameter Guards**: Automated detection of economically dangerous parameter settings
