# Test Plan + Coverage Report

## 1. Introduction

Fluxa is a Hybrid Adaptive AMM with Personalized Yield Optimization built on Solana. This document describes the comprehensive testing approach for Fluxa, detailing unit, integration, fuzz, and property-based tests. The goal is to ensure that all protocol components are secure, performant, and behave as expected under various market scenarios.

## 2. Objectives

- **Validate Functionality**: Ensure that every module (AMM Core, Order Book, IL Mitigation, Yield Optimization, Insurance Fund) meets its functional specifications.
- **Ensure Security**: Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities through rigorous testing methods.
- **Maintain State Integrity**: Confirm that invariants (e.g., liquidity conservation, fee consistency) are preserved across state transitions.
- **Achieve High Test Coverage**: Aim for a minimum of 90% code coverage across unit and integration tests.
- **Facilitate Continuous Improvement**: Provide a clear framework for regression testing and future enhancements.

## 3. Scope

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and logic blocks in each module.

### Integration Tests

- Verify interactions between modules (e.g., liquidity provision followed by order matching and IL rebalancing).

### Fuzz Testing & Property-Based Testing

- Use randomized inputs to uncover edge cases and ensure key invariants hold under all conditions.

### End-to-End Tests

- Simulate complete user journeys from liquidity provision and yield selection to order execution and state updates.

## 4. Testing Methodology

### 4.1 Unit Testing

- **Tools**: Use the Anchor testing framework and Rust’s native testing suite.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Liquidity calculation functions
  - Fee accrual and distribution logic
  - Order placement and cancellation operations
  - Dynamic liquidity curve adjustments and rebalancing triggers
- **Success Criteria**: Each function should return expected results for a wide range of valid and invalid inputs.

### 4.2 Integration Testing

- **Tools**: Deploy on Solana’s local test validator and use scripted interactions to simulate user behavior.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Interactions between the AMM Core, Order Book, and IL Mitigation modules
  - CPI interactions with external protocols (Marinade, Solend, Jupiter)
- **Success Criteria**: The complete workflow should maintain state consistency, execute within expected time frames, and handle error conditions gracefully.

### 4.3 Fuzz Testing & Property-Based Testing

- **Tools**: Utilize fuzz testing libraries (e.g., AFL, cargo-fuzz) and property-based testing frameworks.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Randomized inputs to liquidity functions and order matching logic
  - Verification of key invariants (e.g., total liquidity and fee distribution) across diverse scenarios
- **Success Criteria**: No unexpected behaviors or invariant violations are observed even with randomized and edge-case inputs.

### 4.4 End-to-End Testing

- **Tools**: Automated test scripts and manual testing on a staging environment.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Full user journey from onboarding, liquidity provision, order placement, yield selection, and IL mitigation
- **Success Criteria**: The system behaves as expected and the user interface accurately reflects on-chain state.

## 5. Coverage Report Metrics

### 5.1 Coverage Targets

- **Unit Tests**: Aim for ≥ 90% code coverage.
- **Integration Tests**: Target ≥ 85% coverage on critical interaction paths.
- **Fuzz & Property Tests**: Ensure that 100% of key invariants (e.g., liquidity and fee consistency) are continuously verified.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate 100% of core user journeys and major features.

### 5.2 Reporting Tools

- **Coverage Tools**: Utilize tools such as cargo tarpaulin for Rust to generate detailed coverage reports.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate testing into CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests on every commit.
- **Dashboard**: Develop a real-time dashboard displaying coverage metrics and test results for easy tracking.

| Yield Optimization | 91%           | 86%                  |
| Insurance Fund     | 94%           | 90%                  |
| **Overall**        | **92%**       | **87%**              |

**Invariants Verified**:

- Total liquidity remains consistent: 100%
- Fee distribution integrity: 100%
- Order matching correctness: 100%

## 6. Reporting and Continuous Improvement

- **Test Logs**: Maintain logs for every test run, including failures and performance benchmarks.
- **Issue Tracking**: Document bugs and regressions with detailed descriptions and reproduction steps.
- **Review Cycle**: Regularly review and update tests based on new features, protocol updates, and community feedback.
- **Bug Bounty Integration**: Post-deployment, encourage community-driven testing via bug bounty programs to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.
