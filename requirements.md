# Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

Fluxa is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on Solana, designed to revolutionize liquidity provision and yield optimization. By integrating a hybrid adaptive AMM model with personalized yield strategies, Fluxa leverages Solana's parallel execution model to offer superior capital efficiency, dynamic impermanent loss mitigation, and a user-friendly interface. This document details the functional and non-functional requirements that will guide the development and testing of the Fluxa protocol.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Liquidity Provision and Concentrated Liquidity

- **F1.1 Liquidity Range Specification:**
  - Users must be able to deposit funds and specify custom liquidity ranges, similar to Uniswap v3's concentrated liquidity model.
- **F1.2 Pool Management:**
  - Users should be able to view, modify, and withdraw their liquidity positions, with real-time metrics displaying performance (e.g., fees, yield, impermanent loss).
- **F1.3 Position Analytics:**
  - Provide dashboards that offer insights into LP metrics, including current liquidity, fee accumulation, and potential impermanent loss.

### 2.2 Integrated Order Book Functionality

- **F2.1 Limit Order Placement:**
  - Users must be able to place limit orders directly on the liquidity pools, blending traditional AMM operations with Serum's order book capabilities.
- **F2.2 Order Matching and Execution:**
  - The protocol should support efficient order matching and execute trades based on set parameters in a transparent order book.
- **F2.3 Order Management:**
  - Allow users to cancel or modify their limit orders seamlessly.

### 2.3 Dynamic Liquidity Curves and Impermanent Loss Mitigation

- **F3.1 Automated Liquidity Curve Adjustment:**
  - The AMM should auto-adjust its liquidity curves based on real-time market volatility to minimize impermanent loss.
- **F3.2 Impermanent Loss (IL) Mitigation Protocol:**
  - Implement dynamic rebalancing mechanisms that adjust liquidity ranges automatically, coupled with an insurance fund sourced from a small percentage of trading fees.
- **F3.3 Real-Time IL Dashboard:**
  - Provide users with a dashboard that displays IL coverage, dynamic adjustments, and the status of the insurance fund.

### 2.4 Personalized Yield Optimization

- **F4.1 Risk Profile Selection:**
  - Users must be able to choose their preferred risk/return profile (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive) upon onboarding.
- **F4.2 Adaptive Yield Strategy:**
  - The protocol should dynamically adjust compounding frequencies, liquidity rebalancing, and yield optimization strategies based on the selected risk profile.
- **F4.3 Performance Analytics:**
  - Offer real-time analytics and historical performance data tailored to each user's chosen strategy.

### 2.5 Exceptional UX and Onboarding

- **F5.1 Intuitive User Interface:**
  - Develop a clean, simplified UI that supports one-click liquidity provision and yield strategy adjustments.
- **F5.2 Gamified Scorecards:**
  - Implement visual scorecards that clearly display returns, associated risks, and impermanent loss metrics.
- **F5.3 Integrated Fiat On-Ramp:**
  - Provide seamless entry into the ecosystem by integrating fiat on-ramps for new users.
- **F5.4 Educational Resources:**
  - Include embedded tutorials and short explainer videos to guide users through platform functionalities.

### 2.6 Ecosystem Integrations

- **F6.1 Marinade Integration:**
  - Support liquid staking tokens (e.g., mSOL) for auto-compounding and yield generation.
- **F6.2 Solend/Kamino Finance Integration:**
  - Enable additional yield optimization opportunities by integrating with other Solana-based lending/borrowing platforms.
- **F6.3 Jupiter Aggregator Integration:**
  - Route trades across multiple liquidity pools using Jupiter Aggregator to maximize trading efficiency.

### 2.7 Governance and Tokenomics

- **F7.1 Decentralized Governance Module:**
  - Plan for a community-driven governance module to manage future protocol updates and tokenomics.
- **F7.2 Transparent Tokenomics:**
  - Define protocol fees, incentive structures, and staking mechanisms clearly to ensure community trust and long-term sustainability.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

- **NFR1.1 Low Latency:**
  - Ensure that all transactions (swaps, liquidity updates, order placements) are executed with sub-second latency, leveraging Solana's parallel processing.
- **NFR1.2 High Throughput:**
  - The system must support a high volume of transactions without performance degradation.

### 3.2 Scalability

- **NFR2.1 Modular Architecture:**
  - Design the protocol in a modular fashion, enabling scalability and future integration of additional features without major refactoring.
- **NFR2.2 Concurrent User Support:**
  - The system should handle thousands of concurrent users without compromising performance.

### 3.3 Security and Reliability

- **NFR3.1 Comprehensive Security Testing:**
  - Implement unit, integration, and fuzz tests to ensure robust security across all modules.
- **NFR3.2 Threat Mitigation:**
  - Develop and document threat models and mitigation strategies to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, front-running, oracle manipulation).
- **NFR3.3 Data Integrity and State Consistency:**
  - Ensure the protocol maintains accurate state management and is resilient against unauthorized modifications.
- **NFR3.4 Uptime and Reliability:**
  - Aim for a high system uptime (99.9% or higher) with built-in failover mechanisms.

### 3.4 Usability and Accessibility

- **NFR4.1 Intuitive Design:**
  - The user interface should be designed for ease of use, minimizing the learning curve for both novice and experienced users.
- **NFR4.2 Cross-Device Compatibility:**
  - Ensure the platform is fully accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **NFR4.3 Accessibility Standards:**
  - Adhere to standard accessibility guidelines to provide an inclusive user experience.

### 3.5 Maintainability and Documentation

- **NFR5.1 Code Quality and Documentation:**
  - Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows industry best practices, making future maintenance and upgrades straightforward.
- **NFR5.2 Testing Coverage:**
  - Maintain a high level of test coverage to ensure system robustness and ease of debugging.
- **NFR5.3 Developer Guides:**
  - Provide comprehensive guides for developers to facilitate future contributions and integrations.

### 3.6 Compliance and Auditability

- **NFR6.1 Audit-Ready Design:**
  - Build the protocol with clear audit trails and documentation to support third-party security audits.
- **NFR6.2 Regulatory Considerations:**
  - Ensure that the design complies with relevant regulatory requirements, particularly if features like fiat on-ramps are integrated.
