Regular monitoring of progress along this critical path will be essential for timely project completion.

## 12. Success Criteria

The following criteria will be used to evaluate the success of the implementation:

1. **Functional Completeness**: All core features working as specified
2. **Performance Metrics**: Demonstrable IL reduction of at least 25% compared to traditional AMMs
3. **Visual Impact**: Intuitive visualization of position management and IL reduction
4. **Stability**: No critical bugs during demonstration
5. **Team Readiness**: All team members able to explain their contribution to the project

## 13. Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a structured approach to delivering Fluxa's core differentiating features within the hackathon timeframe. By focusing on the AMM Core and Impermanent Loss Mitigation modules, we can create a compelling demonstration that highlights our unique value proposition.

Regular progress tracking against this timeline, combined with the contingency plans outlined above, will maximize our chances of successful delivery and position us favorably for hackathon success.
